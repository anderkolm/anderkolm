hi

my github doubles as a working portfolio — concise repos, code + plots, reproducible setups. i prefer shipping experiments over writing long docs.

about

undergrad @ UFRJ Mechanical Engineering. my focus is reliability & automation for complex systems: PHM/RUL, control (LQR/MPC/observers), flow assurance basics, and IIoT telemetry (Node-RED → InfluxDB → Grafana). i study and prototype with an eye on high-impact industrial problems (oil & gas, mining, energy, advanced manufacturing).

tooling (open-source): python (numpy/pandas/scipy/scikit-learn), python-control, filterpy, networkx, matplotlib/plotly · node-red, influxdb, grafana, docker · basic CAD (onshape/solidworks – learning parts/assemblies) · markdown/jupyter

what i'm building 

- flow-assurance-lite — synthetic T-P maps for wax/hydrate risk zones + minimal FMEA/Bow-Tie (3 lines) and a dashboard skeleton (Node-RED → Influx → Grafana).  
- predictive-maintenance-starter — feature extraction for machine health + simple RUL baseline and email alerts; no fancy black box, just clear signals and thresholds.  
- mpc-mass-spring — state-space model, LQR and a first MPC sketch with constraints.  
- complex-systems-notes — short notebooks on maps/chaos (lyapunov), kuramoto sync on graphs, percolation/cascades, and stochastic basics.

interests 

reliability/PHM (RCM, FMEA/FMECA, Bow-Tie, RAM, LCC) · control/estimation (pid, lqr, mpc, kalman/luenberger) · process systems engineering (dynamic balances, regime changes, bifurcations) · iiot/ot (instrumentation, telemetry, time sync, data quality) · networks & complexity (structure, cascades, resilience) · safety methods (hazid/hazop/lopa – fundamentals)

currently

- assembling open-source demos for an application to NIDF/UFRJ (multiphase/flow assurance context).  
- looking for lab work (reliability, control, data-driven process systems) and collaborations on small, well-scoped problems.  
- longer-term: bring reliability + control + complexity into real industrial telemetry pipelines.

reading (signals over noise)

kolmogorov, lyapunov, poincaré, prigogine, haken; åström & murray (feedback systems), bertsekas (optimization), ogata (state-space), box (all models are wrong…), jaynes (probability), murray-spiegel (theory of stats). philosophy for method: wittgenstein/heidegger (clarity, constraints of language) — kept practical.
